                What is this application?
            </h1>
            <div className='tutorial-subtext'>
                This application is a tool for visualizing pathfinding algorithms.
                Pathfinding algorithms seek to find the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.
                This application has adapted the algorithms to perform on a grid where vertices are tiles and
                edges are 90 degree paths between adjacent tiles.
            </div>
            <div className='tutorial-subtext'>
                Some pathfinding algorithms are <i>weighted</i> while other algorithms are <i>unweighted</i>.
                Weighted algorithms take into account the cost to travel to a tile, and therefore always find the shortest path.
                Unweighted algorithms don't take into account the cost to travel to a tile, and don't always find the shortest path.
                The shortest path is the path with the lowest cost between the two points.

                    <b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b> (weighted):
                    The most fundamental pathfinding algorithm, it uses path costs to guarantee the shortest path.
                    Out of these algorithms, it is the most expensive to perform and often checks the most nodes.
                </div>
                <div className='text-row'>
                    <b>A* Search</b> (weighted):
                    Uses both path costs and heuristics to guarantee the shortest path while exploring less nodes than Dijkstra.
                    Widely considered to be one of the best pathfinding algorithms.

                <div className='text-row'>
                    <b>Best First Search</b> (unweighted):
                    Uses heuristics to explore nodes closer to the goal.
                    Explores a low amount of nodes, but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

                <div className='text-row'>
                    <b>Breadth First Search</b> (unweighted):
                    A solid algorithm that guarantees the shortest path on unweighted grids, however it will
                    fail to find the shortest path on weighted grids.
                    Very cheap to perform on small grids.

                    <b>Depth First Search</b> (unweighted):
                    A poor algorithm for pathfinding that doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

                Walls cannot be traveled to, and are therefore not explored by any of the algorithms.
                Weights can be traveled to, however they are more costly to travel to. For example,
                Weight[5] is 5 times more costly to travel to than an empty tile.
